                    <h2>Proposal</h2> 
                    <br/>
                    <p> Today the entire world is effected by the invasion of Social Media, right now
                        one of the most popular one is <strong id="instagram">Instragram</strong>.
                        Instagram over facebook, snapchat ecc.. is used by anytype of user, but we would like 
                        to analyze the company's usage of this social media to establish their marketing 
                        strategy and to dig into the knowledge of which kind of features effected the most the number
                        of likes and, more in general, the popularity of a certain brand. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Behind the scenes all of us, browsing into Instagram, have picked some interesting brands
                        to be analysed. We have been focused on the fashion side. Every fashion brand that we choose 
                        has thousands of posts, million of followers and million of likes but we detected some 
                        discrapancies between all of them. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        When we first start our analysis our first assumption was: "An Instagram account with more 
                        followers has more likes than one with less followers", than a comparison 
                        conducted between two different accounts reported interesting findings:
                        Michael Kors and Burberry have, more or less, the same amount of followers, but almost every post
                        of Michael Kors has 2/3 times more likes than Burberry. So we understood that sometimes accounts with
                        less followers has a bigger amount of likes and  we decided to focus our attenction on 
                        "Which factors might matter in order to get more likes":
                        <ul>
                            <li>Daily posting schedule</li>
                            <li>History of brands using Instagram</li>
                            <li>Hashtag usage</li>
                        </ul>
